# ImageOverlayProjects
ECE 484W Projects

Adjusting Image Brightness & Contrast

Image Overlay & Histogram

Projects created using Qt Creator Widgets and Graphical User Interface (GUI). Highly recommend downloading Qt Creator Software or Visual Studio 2019 version for running the programs/milestones. 

Worked on the projects in a team environment during the software and hardware development engineering course.
